                <p>Ashley grew up in Saratoga Springs, NY, where she began practicing yoga in 2006 under the guidance of Yoga Therapist Arletta Behan. While growing up, Ashley’s mother brought her to yoga classes and over the years she she fell in love with
                    the practice and started to become curious how to help people heal, both physically and emotionally. </p>

                <p> Ashley’s curiosity and passion lead her to complete a 200-Hour Multi-Style Yoga Teacher Training through Hawaii Yoga Institute in May of 2014 under the guidance of Professional Integrative Yoga Therapist, Adria Pickett. In pursuit of creating
                    a holistic healing modality,, in February 2016 Ashley completed her training as a Licensed Massage Therapist through Hawaii Healing Arts College. </p>

                <p> Ashley leads a mindful class that incorporates her knowledge of anatomy & physiology, pranayama, meditation, mantra, mudras, Thai Massage, and spirituality. Her intention as a teacher is to help students connect to their mind, body, and
                    soul and to honor their space for personal growth. Ashley’s classes allow her students to look deeper and listen to the divine within through self-awareness and the embodiment of yoga. </p>
