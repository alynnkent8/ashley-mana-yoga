      <p>I’m Ashley!</p>
      <p>I am a lover at my true nature.
      You can feel my sweet presence & warm heart in that space I share with you. Quite literately, I was given the Thai name Waan (sweet) while traveling through Chiang Mai. My deepest wish is that it reaches through my words in raw form. </p>
    </div>



      <p>Im excited by the little things in life…  <!--add font and take out the space between lines-->
      that bring tears to my face from laughing too hard,
      sharing a smile with an absolute stranger while traveling on the road,
      taking in a deep breath of fresh air as I sit on my yoga mat,
      exploring little cafes in the alleyways,
      the empowering movement of solo travel,
      soul to soul conversations that make you feel raw, vulnerable, & ridiculously human,
      rolling around in the sand at the beach like a dog or child,
      learning life from the mountains, oceans, desserts, & forests.
      mysticism, spirit, soul, connection to our highest selves,
      Leading leaders & empowering people to be the best version of themselves.</p>

      <p> By trade I’m…
