      <p>I’m Ashley!</p>
      <p>I am a lover at my true nature.<br>
      You can feel my sweet presence & warm heart in that space I share with you. Quite literately, I was given the Thai name Waan (sweet) while traveling through Chiang Mai. My deepest wish is that it reaches through my words in raw form. </p>
    </div>



      <p>Im excited by the little things in life that… <br>
        bring tears to my face from laughing too hard,<br>
        sharing a smile with an absolute stranger while traveling on the road,<br>
        taking in a deep breath of fresh air as I sit on my yoga mat,<br>
        exploring little cafes in the alleyways of cute cities,<br>
        the empowering movement of solo travel,<br>
        playful shit talking & sarcastic dry humor,<br>
        soul to soul conversations that make you feel raw, vulnerable, & ridiculously human,<br>
        rolling around in the sand at the beach like a dog or child without a care in the world,<br>
        learning life from the mountains, oceans, desserts, & forests.<br>
        mysticism, spirit, soul, connection to our highest selves,<br>
        Leading leaders & empowering people to be the best version of themselves. </p>

      <p> By trade I’m…<br>
	       <ul><p>A yoga teacher</p>

	         <p><li>My jam is teaching intimate classes that focus on a holistic approach to yoga.<br>

	       A massage therapist<br>
	          <p><li>I love incorporating a variety of holistic modalities to specialize a session for each client. I specialize in deep tissue, Thai yoga massage, & prenatal.</p><br>

	        A health & lifestyle coach<br>
